Existing Issues/Task workflow:

1. Look at issues in the backlog of a project on Github
2. Assign an issue to yourself
3. create feature branch from develop branch with the issue number and possibly short description I.E "2-new_end_point"
4. Move the ticket to To Do if you plan on working on it or in progress if you are working on it
5. When committing to a feature branch put hashtag and the number of the issue in the commit message. I.E. "#2 first commit"
6. When your happy with your branch merge it into develop and test your changes work well.
7. If all works well then we can decide best dates to push to release.
