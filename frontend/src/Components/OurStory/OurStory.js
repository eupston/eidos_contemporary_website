                            <p>

                                She makes jewelry that expresses her interest in Indian, Hindu and Buddhist culture using silver and high karat gold . These pieces comment on and reference cultural belief systems which are beginning to be abandoned in that continentâ€™s rush into modernity and western-ism. The multi-layered poetic world-view expressed in East Indian thought and ornamentation in everyday life fascinate her. She sensitively combines elaborate ornament with a moderistic simplicity of form holding these two apparent contradictions in balance.

                                Process is central to his work, which is fabricated and architectonic in form. The minimal lines of his work understate the complex interplay between its personal and universal references. He is very drawn to myth,history and symbolism,and many pieces have a conceptual element that references a personal experience. This narrative is not exclusive but draws on the universality of human feeling, engaging the viewer in a dialogue.
